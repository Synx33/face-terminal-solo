# face-terminal Windows updater.

# touching .env (device IP/credentials, pinned via the dashboard's Settings
# panel) or the data directory (attendance DB, snapshots, backups, logs --
# which in any case lives entirely outside the install path, under
# C:\ProgramData\face-terminal, so this script never goes near it at all).
#
# Run any time from an elevated-or-not PowerShell (it self-elevates):
#   .\windows\update.ps1
#
# This is deliberately NOT a "git pull in place" -- the installed copy at
# C:\Program Files\face-terminal isn't necessarily a git clone itself (older
# installs aren't), so this always fetches a completely fresh, disposable
# clone into a temp folder and copies just the code over, the same way
# install.ps1's first install does. Safe to run repeatedly.
