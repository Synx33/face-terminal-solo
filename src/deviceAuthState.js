// Tracks whether the device is currently rejecting our credentials (HTTP
// 401), so callers can back off instead of hammering it with failed logins.
//
// Why this exists: the poller hits the device every ~1.5s. Before this, a
// 401 was treated exactly like any other transient error — retried at the
// same 1.5s cadence forever. If credentials are ever actually wrong (a typo
// via Settings, or the device's own password changed independently), that
// meant hundreds of failed login attempts per few minutes with no backoff
// at all. Confirmed firsthand on the real device: even a SINGLE failed
// login attempt triggered a ~26-minute admin-login lockout — continuing to
// retry every 1.5s into that lockout window at best does nothing, at worst
// risks extending it further. Once we see a 401, stop trying automatically
// for a long cool-down window instead.

// A single 401 isn't reliable proof the password is actually wrong -- digest
// auth is a two-round-trip handshake (an unauthenticated probe, then a
// retry with the computed Authorization header), and a network blip during
// that second round trip can come back 401 for timing/nonce reasons that
// have nothing to do with the credentials being correct. Confirmed live
// (twice) with the exact same, unchanged, correct password: a real-world
// bad patch on one site's link to its terminal wasn't a single momentary
// glitch either -- the captured log showed THREE separate 10s connection
// timeouts (hard failures below the HTTP layer entirely, not 401s) spread
// across roughly 30+ seconds, with a second genuine 401 landing somewhere
// in that same rough patch. A 2-in-a-row threshold isn't enough margin to
// ride out an episode that long. 3 still catches an actually-wrong password
// almost immediately (the next poll is ~1.5s later each time -- a handful
// of seconds total, nothing a human would notice), while giving a flaky
// link's bad patches real room before concluding the credentials are wrong.
